To deploy:

Deploy the VaultChonk:

	>	npx hardhat chonkDeploy --network polygon
	
	VaultChonk deployed at:  0x89Ca5Dab7E2cFAA9013157A38ea8457247Bb9d19

Deploy the VaultDeploy:

	>	npx hardhat prepareDeploy --network polygon
	
	User account is  0x0894417Dfc569328617FC25DCD6f0B5F4B0eb323
	VaultDeploy deployed at : 0x1ba8315169DE2a3b6eCB26437336fa6189CDB87c
	Please set runs to a low value and recompile


Now actually do this, because the VaultHealer won't deploy if it's too large.

WARNING: If your next transaction on this account is anything other than deploying the vaultHealer, the vaultDeploy will be trash, and you'll have to deploy a new one. The VaultDeploy pattern relies on the assumption that your nonce increases by one and no more.

Deploy the VaultHealer:

	>	npx hardhat vaultHealer --chonk 0x89Ca5Dab7E2cFAA9013157A38ea8457247Bb9d19 --depl 0x1ba8315169DE2a3b6eCB26437336fa6189CDB87c --network polygon
	
	
Verifying:

	Recommend verifying each contract after it is deployed:
	
	>	npx hardhat verify 0x89Ca5Dab7E2cFAA9013157A38ea8457247Bb9d19 --network polygon
	
	For contracts with constructor parameters:
	
	>	npx hardhat verify 0x89Ca5Dab7E2cFAA9013157A38ea8457247Bb9d19 --network polygon <parameters go here>
